**phonorm** is an exploratory project in which we apply a Recurrent Neural Network to the problem of [phonetic normalization](http://mlwiki.org/index.php/Phonetic_Normalization). The need for such a model arose from the type of conversations we observed in our chatbot [ChitChat](https://bitbucket.org/arvid/chitchat), as we observed a lot of text that is written much like it is spoken. Current phonetic algorithms, such as [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) are too aggressive and do not work well in our use case.

You can find our writeup of the project [here](https://github.com/JasperHG90/phonorm/docs/writeup/phonorm_writeup.pdf). Comments are welcome and can either be left in the issues section or can be sent to jasperginn[at]gmail.com

## A note on training the model

If you want to retrain the model using the data in this repository, be aware that training will be **slow** on CPUs.

## Setting up

At a minimum, you need a python 3 installation. However, it would be best to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). The steps below assume that you are using anaconda for this project.

1. Create a new environment called 'phonorm'

```shell
conda create -n phonorm python=3.6 anaconda
```

2. Activate the environment

```shell
source activate phonorm  
```

on Windows:

```shell
conda activate phonorm
```

3. Install dependencies

```shell
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

4. Install 'pywiktionary' from git

5. (optional) install `tensorflow-gpu` if you are using a GPU
